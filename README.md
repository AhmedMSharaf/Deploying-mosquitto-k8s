# Mosquitto Deployment with Volumes in Kubernetes
This project demonstrates how to deploy a Mosquitto message broker in a Kubernetes cluster, and configure it to use volumes for storing its configuration file and secret data.

## Prerequisites
A Kubernetes cluster
kubectl command-line tool
Basic knowledge of Kubernetes and YAML

## Notes
The mosquitto.conf file in the ConfigMap should contain the Mosquitto configuration values, such as log settings and listener ports.
The secret.file in the Secret should contain any sensitive data that Mosquitto requires, such as passwords or certificates.
The mosquitto-deployment.yaml file defines the Mosquitto deployment, including the volume mounts for the ConfigMap and Secret.
The readOnly: true field in the volumeMounts section of the container definition in the deployment configuration sets the secret volume to be read-only.
You can customize the Mosquitto configuration and secret data by modifying the mosquitto.conf and secret.file files, respectively.
